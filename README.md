A sample repository to learn how to use GitHub!

I am a solo developer and dreamer, wanting to make video games and beginning my serious journey. GitHub should be able to help me manage what I make and ensure that, heaven forbid anything awful happens to my computer, anything I make is safe and sound.

I am still learning how exactly GitHub works. Maybe this is how it does its magic?
